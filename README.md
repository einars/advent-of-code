# advent-of-code

Go away, here will be my Clojure solutions for this year's Advent of Code - 202x

You don't need this repo. Solve the problems yourself!


...but if you still do, you can find the code under src/aoc\_202x and solve the problems with:

   ./scripts/run 2023/1

   ./scripts/run

etc.

I love it when everything is clean and orderly, even when that's kind of not the point of AoC.

Run the tests with

   ./scripts/test
