# advent-of-code

Go away, here will be my Clojure solutions for this year's Advent of Code - 2022

(and, as this year seems to be quite easy, probably some other years).

You don't need this repo. Solve the problems yourself!

...but if you still do, you can find the code under src/aoc\_2022 and solve the problems with:

   lein run 2022/6

   lein run


and run the tests with

   lein test
